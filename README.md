# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction (ML Project)

This project uses a supervised machine learning approach to predict wine quality scores based on physicochemical data. The model was trained using XGBoost and evaluated with metrics including a confusion matrix and class accuracy.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- XGBoost, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Google Colab (runtime + visualization)
- [UCI Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)

## 📊 Key Features
- Cleaned and explored the dataset using visual and statistical techniques  
- Trained multi-class XGBoost model to classify wine quality from 0 to 5  
- Visualized performance with a confusion matrix and accuracy metrics  
- Designed for reproducibility in Colab
